        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>
            My mother loves to hike and can often be found hiking the trail every
            single day! She often brings along our family dog—a black lab named
            Jazzi—and hits the trail, loving the time she has to enjoy nature's
            beauty and get her body moving. Often, she will take images of the fun
            scenes she finds, one of her favorite being a tree cracked from the
            insane heat that we have been getting in Washington state lately!
            Seattle is really a beautiful place, and my mother does not take
            advantage of that fact.

              <h3>Gardening</h3>
              <p>
                  Another thing that my mother loves is gardening. From a young age, I
                  remember her being out the garden when the weather is nice to take
                  care of the many flowers and vegetables that she grows there. Although
                  she grows things such as tomatos, carrots, snap dragons, hyacinths,
                  and (my favorite) lilacs; my mother is especially fond of roses and
                  has a lot of different common and rare types of roses in the flower
                  garden that boarders the entirety of our front yard!

                <h3>Pokemon GO!</h3>
                <p>
                    I do not think anyone in our family could have predicted the love that
                    my mother would grow for a humble little mobile game such as Pokemon
                    GO! when it released in 2017. She often compouds her love of hiking
                    with her love of Pokemon GO!, since it is a game that one has to walk
                    around while playing to play to its fullest extent! She will often be
                    "taking gyms" while hiking with my dad and I, and is honestly very
                    good at the game! She sometimes likes to drive out to raids too or
                    tries to find raids within our immediate area.
