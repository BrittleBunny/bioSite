          Barbara Ann Ray is a charming mother of one who is currently thriving
          in the lush, green, Pacific Northwest. She currently lives in
          Kirkland, Washington (although she has lived in California for a time
          in the past) along with her two cats—a girl tabby named “Tinkerbell”
          and a male black cat named “Boo”—husband, and dog—a black labrador
          retriever named “Jazzi.”
        </p>

          In her free time, she very much enjoys hobbies like gardening,
          birdwatching, and playing Pokemon Go. The weather in the greater
          Seattle area is perfect for gardening despite the ongoing rain that
          loves to plague the area. As such, she is very knowledgeable about
          flowers and loves to identify various types she sees while out and
          about or while on vacation. She also loves to birdwatch and recently
          received a birdhouse that has a camera inside of it for Christmas so
          that she can view the various birds that inhabit the area. Pokemon Go
          has been a hobby of hers since the game was released in 2017, and she
          can often be found taking over gyms in the game as she hikes one of
          the many trails or hiking paths that are available in the greater
          Seattle area.

          For her day-to-day job, Barbara inspects medical devices—an industry
          that she has been in for the entirety of her career. She is excellent
          at what she does and works hard so that she can play harder. Her
          favorite vacation spots are Hawaii—where she can enjoy the warm
          weather—and Orlando—where her daughter currently lives and works at
          Walt Disney World.
